# Text Avenger

Developed in Macromedia Director 10 (now Adobe Director) in JavaScript.  I am releasing this under an GNU open source license. Please feel free to modify it as you see fit, so long as you give me credit for the original game.

# How to play

## Windows

To play on Windows, simply download the [textAvenger.zip](https://github.com/kflorence/text-avenger/blob/master/dist/textAvenger.zip), extract the files to a location of your choice, and then run `game.exe`.

## Mac

Unfortunately, Mac has dropped support for PowerPC applications starting with version 10.7 -- so to play this game on a Mac, you will need an older version. If that's the case, simply download [textAvenger-mac.zip](https://github.com/kflorence/text-avenger/blob/master/dist/textAvenger-mac.zip), extract it and the inner `game.osx.hqx` file, then create a folder next to `game.osx` called `storage` and put the `words.txt` file inside it. You should then be able to launch the game by double clicking on `game.osx`.
